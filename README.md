# JobScout

**Scout once. Search everywhere.**

JobScout is a lightweight job-search utility that turns a list of job titles into direct search links across multiple job boards. Add your titles, choose your boards and location, and JobScout handles the rest.

## 📖 Usage

1. **Home** — Paste your job titles, one per line.
2. **Settings** — Select job boards and optionally enter a location.
3. **Generate Searches** — Save your titles and open the Searches page.
4. **Searches** — Open each title directly on your selected job boards.
5. **Manage** — Delete individual titles or clear all searches.

## 🧱 Architecture

Each job board implements a shared `JobBoard` interface with a pure `generateUrl(title, location)` function. This keeps board-specific logic isolated and makes adding new boards straightforward.

User preferences and searches are persisted through a small `localStorage` utility, while React state handles the application's UI state.

## 🔮 Planned

* Application tracking
* Search history
